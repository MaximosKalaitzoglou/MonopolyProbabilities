<h1> Welcome to monopoly breaker!! </h1>
  <p> 
    Are you tired of losing to your younger siblings :smiling_imp: and your closest friends :anger:,
    Do not worry!!<br> :robot: With this "calculator" you will be able to see the probabilities of
    landing on each street.<br> But wait that means.....:bomb: <br> Yes you will know in full detail which color blocks are the
    mathematically correct ones to choose in order to maximize your probability of winning!! :exploding_head:

  <h2>
    Adding more than just probabilities
  </h2>
  <p>
    I am thinking of adding a simulator with stats for each block (interactable phone app)<br>
    As well as extras such as: <ul><li> money managment</li> <li> machine learning predictions based on your position, ownings etc (will the machine seal your fate ?!)</li>
