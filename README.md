    Are you tired of losing to your younger siblings :smiling_imp: and your closest friends :anger:,
    Do not worry!!<br> :robot: With this "calculator" you will be able to see the probabilities of
    landing on each street.<br> But wait that means.....:bomb: <br> Yes you will know in full detail which color blocks are the
    mathematically correct ones to choose in order to maximize your probability of winning!! :exploding_head:

  <h2>
    Adding more than just probabilities
  </h2>
  <p> 
    I am thinking of adding extras such as: <ul>
    <li>
     money managment
    </li>
    <li>
      based on how much money you have and what squares you own(as well as if you have houses/hotels)
      and what your competitors own, how much likely is it for you to win
    </li>
